//Regular expressions are special strings that represent a search pattern.
//Also known as "regex" or "regexp", they help programmers match, search, and replace text. 
//Regular expressions can appear cryptic because a few characters have special meaning. 
//The goal is to combine the symbols and text into a pattern that matches what you want, but only what you want.
